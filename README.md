# To-Do_List
A simple C# application that allows users to add, remove, and show tasks that are on their To-Do List. The tasks would then be stored in a file that was created and stored locally named 'tasks'. This was an attempt for me to improve my C# skills by creating a simple program. This project was created with the help of a few of my peers and friends.
